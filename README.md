# Search Engine
In this project, I built the core part of a search engine. This program can read in any query from the user and return a ranking of the most relevant pages for that query. The algorithm has two main programs - an indexer and a querier. The indexer works by first extracting the relevant tokens and links from each webpage. It then determines the relevance of documents to terms using the term frequency and inverse document frequency metrics. Lastly, the PageRank algorithm is used to determine the rank of pages. The querier works by using a ranking function to consider term relevance and PageRank to return a ranking of the most relevant search results.
